    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course so far, we have emphasized the importance of functional programming as the programming paradigm of choice in data science. However, we neglect to mention how object oriented programming can be helpful to us as data scientists. Object oriented programming is the practice of writing programs that are centered around objects. These objects contain methods and properties all bundled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been using objects all along without knowing. For example, a dataframe is an object. It contains many methods bundled into the dataframe like the isna() function or the shape() method.\n",
    "The Linear Regression Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a relevant example. In the prework module we have learned about linear regression. While we did not introduce the algorithm in great detail, we learned that linear regression is a method to model the relationship between the predictor (or independent) variables and the response (or dependent variable). To find the best model between the predictor and response variables, we must optimize the sum of squared errors. This means that we find the difference between each observation and the predicted value, square these differences and add them up. The smallest such sum will give us the best linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find this optimal model, let's write our own regression function."
